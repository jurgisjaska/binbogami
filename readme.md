## Code Style and Naming Conventions

### Handler Methods

Recommended handler method names for HTTP methods.

| Method | Endpoint        | Name    |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| GET    | /resources      | index   |
| GET    | /resources/{id} | show    |
| POST   | /resources      | create  |
| PUT    | /resources      | update  |
| DELETE | /resources/{id} | destroy |

### JSON API

Service communicates using JSON API where JSON is formated to follow `camelCase` naming.

```json
{
  "description": "this is a description",
  "organizationId": "3f89f6b5-3760-4d85-8b2e-31cca32e4913"
}
```

### Organization Header

All requests going into endpoints under `v1` namespace must have a header `organization` with an active organization ID.

### Database

Database uses plural table names (ex.: `users`) and snake_case names with suffixes for fields (ex.: `created_at`)

### Repositories

Convention for repository method naming and return types.

| Method             | Return     | Description                                                        |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Get({id})          | Entity     | Query single entity by ID                                          |
| FindBy...({value}) | Collection | Query collection of entities by field in the method name and value |
| Find({criteria})   | Collection | Query collection of entities by filter criteria                    |
| Save({entity})     | Entity     | Persist entity (create or update)                                  |
| Create({entity})   | Entity     | Persist **new** entity in the database                             |
| Update({entity})   | Entity     | Persist **existing** entity to the database                        |

Methods that return collection always return collection, if there are no records collection will empty.
If entity is returned failing query will return `nil`.
